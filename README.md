▶️ Usage

Run the script with the following format:

node scrapeReviews.js "Company Name" YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD source


Arguments:

Company Name → Name of the product/company (e.g., "Slack")

YYYY-MM-DD → Start date (e.g., 2025-01-01)

YYYY-MM-DD → End date (e.g., 2025-06-30)

source → g2, capterra, or trustradius

📂 Output

Reviews are saved as a JSON file in the project root.

File naming convention:

{CompanyName}_{Source}_reviews.json


Example:

Slack_trustradius_reviews.json


Sample JSON Output:

[
  {
    "title": "Great for team communication",
    "reviewer": "Amie S.",
    "date": "2025-09-30",
    "rating": 5,
    "pros": "Easy to use, mobile + desktop support",
    "cons": "Notification overload at times",
    "problemsSolved": "",
    "source": "G2"
  }
]

⚠️ Error Handling

Invalid company name → Script exits with a message.

Invalid date format → Must be YYYY-MM-DD.

Start date after end date → Throws error.

"Load More" or lazy-loaded reviews stop appearing → Script gracefully stops and saves available reviews.

Example Error Output:

node scrapeReviews.js "NonExistentProductXYZ" 2023-01-01 2026-01-01 g2

Scraping g2 reviews for "NonExistentProductXYZ" between 2023-01-01 and 2026-01-01
Navigating to G2: https://www.g2.com/products/nonexistentproductxyz/reviews
No reviews found or invalid company/product name.
Scraping failed: No reviews available for the given company.

🏆 Bonus: Third Source

In addition to G2 and Capterra, this scraper also supports TrustRadius, with the same functionality and output structure.
